# WorldBankDataVisualizer
This visualizer will take data from the WorldBank's data repository depending on the user selected country, year range, method of visualization and analyis type. It then processes the retrieved data for different analyses if needed, and renders it using the selected method of visualization (graphs, plots, report, etc).
